The `data-ed-psyctr` dataset is a meta-analytic research domain ([MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf)) on cognitive behavioral interventions for adults with eating disorders (bulimia, anorexia, binge eating disorder). This MARD is part of the  [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-ed-psyctr/blob/master/metadata/last_search.txt). This dataset includes **cognitive behavioral therapy vs. control ('psy vs ctr')** comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for outcomes at post-test. The results of a meta-analysis using this database can be read in this  [published article](https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2025.2495950).

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/). All included information has been independently extracted two researchers. Risk of bias ratings were conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool (Version 1). Re-ratings using version 2 of the tool are currently ongoing.
